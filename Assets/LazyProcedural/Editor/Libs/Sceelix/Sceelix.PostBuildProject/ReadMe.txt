==================================
PostBuild Project
Author: Sceelix
==================================

This project is empty - it is only meant to have its postbuild events executed, which are meant to be after all other libraries have been built.
For that to be possible, its dependencies in the Solution Configuration should be set to all the other libraries.


ChangeLog

What makes a good change log?
http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/

A good change log sticks to these principles:

* It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.
* Easy to link to any section (hence Markdown over plain text).
* One sub-section per version.
* List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).
* Write all dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. (Example: 2012-06-02 for June 2nd, 2012.) It’s international, sensible, and language-independent.
* Explicitly mention whether the project follows Semantic Versioning.
* Each version should:
* List its release date in the above format.
* Group changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:
* Added for new features.
* Changed for changes in existing functionality.
* Deprecated for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
* Removed for deprecated features removed in this release.
* Fixed for any bug fixes.
* Security to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.
